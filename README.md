# Voting-Methods-NLP
This paper gives a new insight into the process of voting. Voting on a large scale during elections is always computed amongst two individuals. But, on a smaller scale such as sporting teams, government electoral systems and academic institutions, preference based voting is performed. To implement the same, various methods were proposed to declare the winner. Adapted from a paper at The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, we have implemented two outstanding proposed methods in Java. The two methods â€“ Borda Count and Condorcet Winner Methods were implemented using a GUI interface. We have tabulated the preferences after the vote has been cast by a number of users. Using these tabulated results, we have compared the two methods.
